## Overview
The backend implements a **Blockchain-Backed Data Exchange Broker** for secure, auditable, and real-time cross-border healthcare data sharing.  
It is based on two Spring Boot microservices:

- **System A** → India Hospital (**Data Provider**)  
- **System B** → Ireland Hospital (**Data Requester**)  

Data exchange is secured using:
- **AES-256 encryption** – Confidentiality  
- **ECDSA digital signatures** – Authenticity & Integrity  
- **Hyperledger Fabric** – Immutable Audit Logs  
- **HL7 FHIR** – Healthcare Data Interoperability

# Getting Started

To run the Cross-Border Healthcare Data Exchange system, supporting services and hospital microservices need to be started.  

Please refer to the [backend setup README](cross-border-healthcare/README.md) for detailed instructions on:  
- Starting Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Hyperledger Fabric  
- Initializing the Fabric channel and deploying chaincode  
- Running System A (Data Provider) and System B (Data Requester)  
- Triggering cross-border data requests
